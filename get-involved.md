## What is Motus?

The [Motus Wildlife Tracking System](https://motus.org) (hereafter Motus: _Latin for movement or motion_) is an international collaborative research network that uses cooperative automated radio telemetry to track small flying organisms (birds, bats, and insects). The system enables the conservation science community to undertake cost-effective, impactful research and education on the ecology and conservation of hundreds of species simultaneously. Motus is a program of Birds Canada in collaboration with a wide network of researchers and organizations.\
\
Motus collaborators deploy small radio transmitters that are detected by Motus stations placed at strategic locations throughout the landscape which can detect tags up to 20 km away. Depending on the configuration of a receiver array, tags can be monitored continuously, or as they occupy space monitored by other stations in the landscape. From the outset the philosophy behind Motus has been that we should all be working together. Motus harnesses the collective power of individuals and organizations into a coordinated coalition that expands the scale and amplifies the impact of everyone’s work, and optimizes scarce research and conservation dollars.&#x20;

Motus collaborators currently maintain more than [1,200 stations in 31 countries](https://motus.org/data/receiversMap?lang=en). More than [400 projects](https://motus.org/data/projects) have deployed over 30,000 tags on more than 250 species of birds, bats, and insects. These data have contributed to [130 academic publications](https://motus.org/data/publications) covering a wide range of disciplines such as breeding and post-breeding dispersal, stopover and migration behavior, habitat use, and overwintering ecology.\
\
Data collected by Motus is revolutionizing our understanding of migratory animals and is being used in conservation planning for species and sites, status assessments and recovery plans for species at risk, environmental assessment and mitigation planning for development projects, and contributing to numerous continental conservation efforts.

## How to get involved in station network development

Tagged animals can only be detected if they pass within range of a Motus station, so ensuring that stations are strategically positioned across the landscape is important to allow for tracking throughout as much of their life cycle as possible.

There are two primary ways to participate in building and maintaining the Motus station network:

1. [**Host a Motus station**](get-involved.md#1-host-a-station)\
   and/or
2. **Support a Motus Station**

### **1) Host a Station**

Each new station increases the area across which tagged animals can be tracked. However, not every location is a great candidate for a Motus station.

#### What makes a site suitable for a Motus station?

The most important factor is that the antennas have an unobstructed view in the direction they are facing. For this reason, the _**highest point on the surrounding landscape** (within 5-10 km)_ is usually preferred. This may be a hill or other prominent feature, shoreline, a station attached to an existing building, or a standalone station that exceeds the height of any nearby trees or features.

Along with the strictly necessary, there are some other features that make some sites better than others:

* _Unobstructed line-of-sight for the antennas_ is essential
* _Fills a gap in the network_ (10 km or more away from the next [nearest station](https://motus.org/data/receiversMap?lang=en))
* _AC power_ adds reliability and reduces cost compared to solar and battery setup
* _Internet_ (WiFi or hard wired) allows regular data uploads and quicker identification of issues
* _Existing structures_ to attach the antennas to (like an unused TV or communications tower) can lower the cost of installation and increase long term durability
* _Ease of access_ keeps time and travel costs down for installation and maintenance

#### Examples of stations

Motus stations come in many shapes and sizes, but at minimum each one consists of a radio receiver, one or more antennas, and a power supply. The exact configuration depends on the specific site, but a  handful of examples are pictured below.

**Commitment, Liability, and Cost**

When installing a new station, we prefer to aim for at least a 5-10-year commitment from the landowner to host the station. However, these agreements are non-binding, and if a landowner requests the station be removed prior to this time, this can be accommodated.

Birds Canada holds $5 million public liability insurance to cover staff and volunteers during the installation of the equipment, as well as all public and private landowners from liability created by installed equipment throughout the duration of the project. If embarking on an independent station installation you will want to confirm your own insurance requirements.\
\
In most cases the costs for station equipment, installation, and maintenance is covered by the Motus collaborator requesting to setup the station. There are no annual fees to station hosts and landowners.&#x20;

**Benefits to the Host**

* Supporting one of the largest collaborative migratory animal conservation science and research initiatives in the world
* Access to visualizations of animal movement data collected from yours and other stations
* Educational opportunities using the infrastructure, data, or technology
* Opportunity to actively participate in ongoing research and monitoring projects
* Opportunities for mutual outreach, promotion and community engagement
* Conversation starter/piece and decorative landscape art

### **2) Support a Motus Station**

One of the largest obstacles to station setup and maintenance is funding. Even if a perfect site is available, a lack of suitable funding can prevent a station from coming together.

#### What does a station cost?

The cost of a station varies widely depending on the configuration of the station, number of antennas, needs for power, ease of access of the station, etc. We generally offer an estimate of roughly $7.5k as a ballpark for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of a “typical” station. In some cases, where existing infrastructure is already in place and can be used, the cost can be significantly lower. For installations in remote areas, or which require specialized contactors to install, the cost could be higher. See Table 1. for an estimate of station costs.
