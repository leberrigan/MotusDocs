## Detection Data

<table><thead><tr><th width="195">Term</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hit</strong></td><td>A single tag detection (equivalent to one 'burst').</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Run</strong></td><td>A collections of consecutive hits. Up to 60 bursts can be missed (not detected) before a new run starts.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Run length</strong></td><td>The number of detections in the run</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Batch</strong></td><td>A batch of data collected over the same receiver boot session.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Tags

<table><thead><tr><th width="195">Term</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tag Project ID</strong></td><td>The ID of the Motus project that manages the tag. The user requests which project the tag be registered upon ordering tags.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Motus Tag ID</strong></td><td>This is a Motus database ID unique to the physical tag and the project it sits in. If the tag was deployed twice between two projects (rare), there may be two tag IDs that exist for the same tag – one for each project.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag Deployment ID</strong></td><td>This is a database ID defined by Motus which is unique to a single tag deployment record i.e., instance when a tag was attached to an individual animal. If the tag is recovered off the animal, the deployment is ended.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manufacturer ID or mfgID</strong></td><td>The ID of the tag as defined by the manufacturer. This is the ID that is also digitally encoded in the radio signal transmitted by the tag. It corresponds to the digits printed on the tag for Lotek tags.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag ID</strong></td><td>Generally refers to the Motus Tag ID within Motus documentation, but informally it can also mean the manufacturer ID.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Burst</strong></td><td>A single transmission by the tag which contains its digitally encoded ID. A burst is made up of Pulses. This is equivalent to a 'hit' in the detection data.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Burst Rate; Burst Interval; or Period</strong></td><td>Time interval between successive bursts (in seconds). This value is measured from the sample recording of the tag.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Period SD</strong></td><td>Standard deviation of the time interval between successive bursts (in seconds). This value is measured from the sample recording of the tag.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frequency or Nominal Frequency</strong></td><td>The central radio frequency used to transmit the signal, usually reported in megahertz (MHz).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frequency offset</strong></td><td>The difference between the nominal frequency and the measured frequency of the tag, usually reported in kilohertz (KHz). This value is measured from the sample recording of the tag.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pulse length</strong></td><td>Tag pulse length (in milliseconds). Pulses make up a Burst. This value is measured from the sample recording of the tag.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Datebin</strong></td><td>Period (i.e., year and quarter-annum) when the tag was registered.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date Registered</strong></td><td>The date the tag was registered with motus.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag Type</strong></td><td>Type of signal transmitted by the tag (e.g. Beeper or ID).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag Codeset</strong></td><td>If a manufacturer has more than one code set from which a code can come, this must uniquely identify the one for this tag (e.g., ‘Lotek-3).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag manufacturer</strong></td><td>Tag manufacturer (e.g., Lotek or CTT).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tag model</strong></td><td>Information on the model of tag (e.g., NTQB-3-2).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Estimated tag lifespan</strong></td><td>How many days after activation the tag is expected to last based on the tag model. This value is calculated using the model and period.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Estimated buffered lifespan</strong></td><td>Predicted lifespan plus an additional 50% to account for unusually long-lasting tags.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anticipated deployment start date</strong></td><td>Placeholder dates that begin on the earliest date which tags are expected to be deployed. This date tells us when to start looking for the tag in detection data. This date can be inputted upon registration of the tags, or anytime before the actual deployment of tags.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Confirmed deployment start date</strong></td><td>The exact deployment dates and times for each tag provided after tag deployment. Confirmation is required after the anticipated date has passed by updating the tag deployment metadata.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pending tag deployment</strong></td><td>Tag deployment record does not have a start date, or start date is in the future.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active tag deployment</strong></td><td>Currently active in the system based on start date, estimated life span, and absence of an end date. Indicates that the deployment can be activated and looked for by Tag Finder between start date and calculated end date (start date + lifespan).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terminated tag deployment</strong></td><td>User provided a known end date to deployment because the tag has been recovered from the animal. This indicates a finalized deployment. If the tag has remaining lifespan it can either be redeployed or deprecated.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Estimated deployment end date/time</strong></td><td>A deployment end date that is calculated by Motus based on tag lifespan plus an additional 50% to account for unusually long-lasting tags. This date is used when the user leaves the end date/time blank.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terminated deployment date/time</strong></td><td>User manually inputs a known end date when they recover the tag from the animal or end a “tag test”.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deprecated tag</strong></td><td>A tag that the user has/had in their possession, but has been damaged, expired, or lost and will never be (re-)deployed. Users can check this box to allow tag properties to be released for use by other projects.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deleted tag</strong></td><td>Tag registered to a project by manufacturer, but fails to turn on or is returned to the manufacturer. The tag was therefore never activated and we do not want to match detections to this tag. Tag has been deleted from both the motus and Tag Finder database entirely.</td></tr></tbody></table>
