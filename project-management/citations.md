# Citations

Citations ensure accurate acknowledgement of an individual’s or organization’s role in a project. Citations are to be used wherever project summary data is reproduced, used in a collaborative research project, presentation, or website.

## Citation **Format**

Citations can be formatted based on institutions or collaborators listed in the project. By default, the format will be based on the project's institutions, but if none are listed it will be based on the projects collaborators.

* To edit your project's institutions, see [**Institutions**](institutions.md)
* To edit your project's collaborators, see [**Collaborators**](collaborators.md)
* To edit your project's citation format, go to [**Manage Collaborators, Institutions, and Citations**](https://motus.org/data/project/users) and scroll to the bottom of the page.
