# Tag Registration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deploying tags without registration is futile – always ensure tags are registered to your Motus project prior to deployment.
{% endhint %}

All tags used with Motus must first be registered before any data can be acquired from Motus stations.

## Automatic Registrations

With some exceptions, all tags purchased from Lotek or CTT are registered automatically to a Motus project upon shipment. This means you must provide the tag manufacturer with your Motus project ID when ordering your tags.

1. [Register](https://motus.org/data/user/new) with Motus
2. Create or join a project
3. Provide the manufacturer (CTT or Lotek) with your project ID when purchasing tags.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Double check that your tags are registered to the **correct project** before deployment.
{% endhint %}

## Manual Registrations

In some specific instances, it may be necessary for you to register your tags manually. _**Only do this if you have been instructed by Motus.**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not register tags more than once. If you need tags transferred between projects [contact us](https://motus.org/contact/).
{% endhint %}

1. [Register](https://motus.org/data/user/new) with Motus
2. [Register your tags](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/VHF\_Tag\_Registration): Instructions on registering tags can be found [here](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/VHF\_Tag\_Registration). To register a tag, you need to make a short recording of its output using a [funcubedongle](http://www.funcubedongle.com) attached to a PC. Tag Registration Kits can be purchased from Motus. Each kit includes a funcube, whip antenna, and tag activator. We strongly encourage you to test and register all tags immediately after receiving them to ensure they’re ready for deployment. **Always check your Manage Tags page after registration to ensure they have all been uploaded correctly.**
3. [Upload tag registrations](https://motus.org/data/project/sgJobs): Send us your completed tag registrations from step 2 [here](https://motus.org/data/project/sgJobs) using your Motus login information.

### Incorrect Burst Intervals

Sometimes bad recordings can result in tag registrations with burst intervals that are an _**integer multiple**_ of the true burst interval. This is because the recording quality was poor and certain tag bursts were skipped during the registration process.

This issue should be resolved in a timely manner by [contacting us](https://motus.org/contact) with the details including the [<mark style="color:green;">**Motus Tag ID**</mark>](../../glossary.md#tags) and the true burst interval that should have been recorded.

If this issue is not resolved it will result in missed detections and at least 50% shorter [<mark style="color:green;">**runs**</mark>](../../glossary.md#tags).
{% endhint %}

## Tag Fees

Your project will be invoiced based on the number of tags registered following the [Motus Collaboration Policy and Fee Schedule](https://motus.org/policy2022/).

Please[ contact us ](https://motus.org/contact)if you have any questions regarding tag fees.
