# Receivers

The Motus Network mostly consists of stationary automated radio telemetry stations which continuously record incoming radio pulses. Mobile stations also exist, either affixed to a moving vehicle, boat, or in a backpack on foot. Other receivers are used for manual tracking so that wildlife can be located in and observed in-person for more precise location data.

## Automated Telemetry Receivers

There are three types of receivers compatible with Motus that can be purchased, or built yourself in some cases: Lotek Wireles Inc (SRX600, 800 and D-series receivers), CTT Sensorstation and Nodes, and the open-source SensorGnome.

Sensorgnomes can be purchased from [Compudata](https://compudata.ca/sensorgnome/) or [RFS Scientific](https://www.rfsscientific.com/) or built with the [following instructions](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How\_do\_I\_build\_a\_SensorGnome/). Note these instructions are very outdated and require revision. New instructions will be posted in the near future.

_**(1)** Price does not include cost of: Wi-Fi module; cellular module; data plans; case; power supply; bulkheads (1 required per antenna); or testing time._

_**(2)** CTT charges $5/month base plus data costs for cellular data plans and an additional $5/month for station health reports. Contact CTT for more details._

_**(3)** Cost for self-built SensorGnomes is estimated to be \~$150 USD without dongles, but prices may vary. Instructions on building SensorGnomes can be found_ [_here_](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How\_do\_I\_build\_a\_SensorGnome/) _and_ [_here_](https://sensorgnome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raspberry\_pi\_sensorgnome.html)_, but note these are outdated and require revision. New instructions will be posted in the near future. **We do not recomend collaborators build their own SensorGnome without prior experience**._

## Manual Telemetry Receivers

For manual telemetry, we need a portable receiver that can decode tag IDs in real time.
