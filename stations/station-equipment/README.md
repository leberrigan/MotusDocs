# Station Equipment

A Motus station consists of three main components:&#x20;

* **Receiver:** this is the computer which records and stores the radio data
* **Antennas:** there are several types of antenna designs. They are 'tuned' to listen to a narrow range of frequencies. Each antenna gets its own coaxial cable and depending on the receiver type and listening frequency, it's own 'dongle', or USB devices which listen to a specified frequency range (i.e., software defined radio).
* **Power supply:** this provides power to the receiver. Most off-grid stations us solar power, but AC power is most reliable. The number one reason for a station to malfunction is a power failure.
