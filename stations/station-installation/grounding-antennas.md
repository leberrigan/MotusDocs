# Grounding Antennas

In regions where thunderstorms are frequent, we recommend that Motus stations be grounded. We have kindly been provided with instructions for how to make Motus stations R56 compliant in the PDF document below. Note that even if R56 compiance is not a requirement for your Motus stations, this document provides helpful guidance on grounding your Motus station.
