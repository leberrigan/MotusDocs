# Tag Deployment

Motus supports two types of uniquely coded radio transmitters: NanoTags™ manufactured by [Lotek Wireless Inc](http://lotek.com/), operating on frequencies 166.380 MHz (Western Hemisphere), 150.100 MHz (Europe), and 151.500 MHz (Australia), and LifeTag™ and PowerTags™ manufactured by [Cellular Tracking Technologies](http://www.celltracktech.com/) (CTT) operating on 434 MHz globally. The two tags use fundamentally different transmission and coding systems.

Tags range in size from \~0.2 g to \~2.6 g, and lifespans vary from 20 days to infinity, depending on the model. It is important to check the [Motus Receiver Map](https://motus.org/data/receiversMap) to confirm which frequency other stations/antennas are operating on throughout the network. When communicating with Lotek or CTT, be sure to explicitly state that you want your tags/system to be compatible with Motus. Be sure to review our [Motus Tag Guide](broken-reference) in detail. Please [contact Motus](https://motus.org/contact), or the tag providers above for more information.

All tags **MUST** be registered with Motus prior to deployment!

## Steps

1. [**Register a Motus user.**](https://motus.org/data/user/new) Collaborators wishing to deploy tags must first register with Motus.
2. [**Join or create a project**](../../project-management/introduction.md)**.** A Motus project is required before purchasing and registering Motus tags. In order for tags to be detected using the Motus network, they must be registered to a Motus project.&#x20;
3. [**Purchase and Register Tags**](https://docs.motus.org/motus-docs/tags/tag-selection#purchasing-tags)**:** When ordering tags, provide the manufacturer with your Motus project ID.&#x20;
4. [**Register an anticipated tag deployment:**](../../project-management/tag-management/#anticipated-deployments) this is a required for battery-powered tags to be detected by our system. You can add multiple tag deployments by using our [**Tag Deployment Bulk Editor**](../../project-management/tag-management/#tag-deployment-bulk-editor). For more information about tag metadata and how deployments are used to detect tags, see [**Tag Metadata**](../../project-management/tag-management/tag-metadata.md#why-metadata-is-so-important).  **Data from these tags will not be processed without a deployment.**&#x20;
5. [**Deploy tags.** ](../../tags/tag-deployment/)Several techniques exist to deploy Motus tags and more are being developed and tested. This document provides instructions for affixing tags to a variety of species. If your group uses different methods, or have any additional information, please [contact Motus](https://motus.org/contact).

Battery-powered tags must be **activated** and **confirmed to be ON** and emitting the expected ID before deployment.

In some specific cases tags may have to be registered manually. For instructions on manual registrations, see [**Tag Registration**](../../project-management/tag-management/tag-registration.md)
