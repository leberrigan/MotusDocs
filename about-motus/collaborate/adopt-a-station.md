# Adopt a station

Volunteers are an essential part of the Motus network and are needed in order to help researchers maintain stations and download data. If you are interested in assisting researchers by [sponsoring](https://motus.org/adopt/donate) or maintaining a station near you, find the owner of a Motus station near you using our receiver map and [**contact Motus**](https://motus.org/contact) for more information.
