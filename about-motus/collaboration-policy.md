# Collaboration Policy

Because Motus manages and shares data across numerous projects and jurisdictions, a [Collaboration Policy](https://motus.org/policy2022/) has been developed to ensure that all researchers know what to expect when joining Motus. There is currently no formal agreement in place, but by registering tags or receivers with Motus, you are agreeing to the terms of the policy.

Motus has also developed a basic fee structure to help cover core data handling and management costs associated with the system. Fees are described within **Section 3.5 Motus Data Services Fees** of the [Collaboration Policy](https://motus.org/policy2022/).&#x20;
